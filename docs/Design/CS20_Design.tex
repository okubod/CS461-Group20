\begin{abstract}
This document describes the implementation of the MR for Infrastructure Maintenance system.
The system as proposed is intended to create visualization of BIM information and CAD models for individuals in design, maintenance, and education of Civil and Construction Engineering.
The system has three use cases for a single actor, the user, and seven components.
These components are the 3D model, detailed model information, anchors, internet connection, controls, viewing port.
Three classes were identified for the system, with the Model, BIMData, and UIPanel classes.
BIMData has a composition relationship to the Model class as BIM detailed data pertains to the model.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the proposed implementation of the MR for Infrastructure Maintenance system.
The MR for Infrastructure Maintenance system is designed to provide a mixed reality interface for viewing BIM models for the purpose of construction and maintenance.
\par

\section{Scope}
This document describes the details of implementation of the MR for Infrastructure Maintenance system.
The software will consist of three major functions.
The first function is to render a BIM model, second is to display detailed data from the BIM, and third is adding detailed data to the BIM.
The document will not specify specific BIM data or models.\par

\section{Context}
Maintenance and education in civil and construction engineering has recently started use of BIM with CAD models for maintaining large projects.
These models provide opportunity to create augmented/mixed reality applications to aid those in these fields with the visualization of the designs.
This design document details the method proposed to implement a software system for this visualization.
\par

\section{Summary}
This document provides an overview of the system and its architecture and system design.
In the end, a rationale is presented for the system design.

\section{Identified Stakeholders}
The stakeholders for this system are the client, Yelda Turkan, the students of Oregon State University School of Civil and Construction Engineering, and the development team.\par

% not all viewpoints are necessary, comment out any that are not needed
% viewpoint sections are meant for defining the name, design concerns, and design language of the viewpoint
% view sections are meant for describing the design view itself
% these don't need to be the sections. This is just for starting point
%\section{Context Viewpoint}
\section{Context View}
The system consists of one actor, the user of the system, and three services.
The primary service of the system is to render a BIM model in a mixed reality environment.
This service is provided to one user of the system that will be viewing the model.
A user may view multiple different models at a single time due to a single BIM file may have multiple modeled components.
This service is extended by viewing more detailed data of the BIM model.
This detailed data may include building material and metric information of the component.
The detailed data view is extended further by adding/editing this detailed data.
These services are modeled in Figure 1 below.
\par
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UseCaseDiag.eps}
    \caption{UML Use Case Diagram}
    \label{fig:UseCaseDiagram}
\end{figure}
The two services extending the rendering of a BIM model component have a maximum of one multiplicity as there is only one set of data to be pulled for each component.
However, both of these services require that the first service is active.
In other words, a model must be loaded and rendered in order to view detailed data.
For the service of adding BIM data, the user will provide input in the form of strings and floats.
The output of the system is a graphics render on a screen of camera feed from the device and the 3D model, as well as display text of detailed data.
\par
\section{Composition View}
The system will have multiple important components to allow for the User to interact with the structure information and allow for the device to communicate with online databases. These include a 3D model visualization, detailed information about the 3D model, Anchors, internet connections, database connections, various user controls, and a viewing port.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Viewing port:} 3D model placed in the real world with detailed views of specific structure parts physical model of a structure based on a connected BIM360 database. The overall model will be viewed from afar but also parts of the model can be 'zoomed in' on to show a detailed view.
    \item \textbf{Detailed Model Information:} When viewing the 3D model in a more detailed view (e.g.: viewing a specific structural pillar), BIM360 information will be shown for that portion.
    \item \textbf{Anchors:} The anchors are spots to 'attach' the 3D model to the real world.
    \item \textbf{Internet Connection:} Required to download and upload BIM files.
    \item \textbf{Database Connection:} Connect to a BIM360 database that is related to specific structure.
    \item \textbf{User Controls:} Allows the user to place anchors, move the camera, and interact with model view to change from a overview and a detailed view.
    \item \textbf{Viewing port:} User's 'view point' where the 3D model anchored in the real world can be seen and interacted with. Would zoom into a selected part for a detail view.
\end{itemize}
%\section{Logical Viewpoint}
\section{Logical View}
There are three identified classes for the system shown in Figure 2.
The BIMData class is a composition of the Model class as the system creates a BIMData object for the Model object, if the user chooses to view detailed data.
The UIPanel class is an object for creating a window in the Unity Engine to display the BIM data.
The class will get data from the BIMData class using the get\_qualities and get\_quantities methods.\par
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ClassDiagram.eps}
    \caption{UML Class Diagram}
    \label{fig:ClassDiagram}
\end{figure}
For the use case of adding detailed data, the BIMData class has two additional methods called add\_quantity() and add\_quality() to add new entries into the data of the model.\par

%\section{Dependency View}
%\section{Patterns View}
\section{Interface View}
The system's interface will feature two types of viewing screens and a login screen. The login screen will allow the user to connect the necessary BIM360 database and choose what structure they want to use. The two types of viewing screens will be the 'Model view' and 'Detailed View'.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{'Model View':} While not in a detailed view of specific part, view port shows simplified 3D model of area of structure in field of view of device's camera
    \item \textbf{'Detailed View':} User can choose a specific part of the model and view more details from the database.  This view zooms in on the specific part of the model.
    \item \textbf{BIM details Menu:} A pop-up menu with BIM information pulled from the BIM360 object.
    \item \textbf{Anchor points:} Pre-determined anchor points visible in the Model View that will be used to allow the user to 'attach' models to keep them in place when moving the device.
    \item \textbf{BIM360 login:} A login menu will be provided to connect to BIM360 database, it will be required before loading anything or accessing the rest of the software. There will be an option for the software to remember the user's login information or staying logged in.
\end{itemize}
\section{Structure View}
A 3D model of the structure from the BIM360 file is displayed on the device's screen, and is anchored in the real-world. The 3D model stays anchored in one location, and allows the user to view different parts of the structure by physically changing the perspective. The user is also able to interact with specific components of the model.

\section{Interaction View}
3D model + Detailed BIM - show BIM for specific part of structure when part is being viewed in a 'detailed' view.

\vspace{1cm}
\textbf{User Input Management}
User input is the information entered by users during the running of the MR application and it is about whole or a piece of the 3d model they are working on, the information could include text, chart, graph, audio, video and more if needed. When such information entered, it should temporarily stay on the running device’s memory since it is time-consuming to go back and forth between hard drive and memory, and then be saved to the hardware and cloud storage when the application is finished. Also, since such information is not entered at once, it needs to keep track of its history to re-display to user properly, and it should be organized in certain format and structure to correctly embed into the interface.\par
The user input management should be part of the main program that displays the 3d model and interacts with the database and local object file. In the main program, the part is unseen until the user required and should be handled as an event during the main loop of the program. When the function is invoked, the program should allow users to enter new information in the interface and allow them to upload image or video as a link or an address of the file. If the entered file is in small size, it should keep in the memory until the program is finished, otherwise saved in hard drive, also for the large size of data like video, it should be entered as a link. When the whole program is finished, it should sort all its original data and the new entered one and write into a file and stored at the hard drive and cloud server, and this part should involve version control system like the database BIM 360 used in the project.\par
The user input management should be implemented at the late stage of the implementation and after when displaying and interaction with the 3d model is finished. The user input management part dependents on the 3d model where the information is attached on, but it could develop separately with the 3d model display when the basic structure is finished. And the test of it should be done by extracting previously entered data and seeing if current entered data is re-displayed properly.


\section{Algorithm View}
World Anchors - the software needs to be able to recognize when the camera is moving, while also keeping the object in place by recognizing anchor points that were placed. The object will be rotated with the device's camera movement to allow the user to view different sides as if it were physically sitting in the real-world.

\section{Resources View}
BIM360 Interfacing - Overall interfacing from BIM360 will be used as a resource for displaying options to users.
%\section{Resources View}

\section{Design Rationale}
The three classes were designed to create the object oriented nature necessary, as a single BIM project may have multiple models, each with their own detailed data for viewing and adding to. There was consideration for an additional class for the anchors that hold the location of the 3D model, however this was changed due to the discovery of the Vuforia SDK plugin for unity. This plugin makes the anchors something the system will interface with, as opposed to creating. The user interface's purpose will be to streamline the start-up process and make interaction and overall use of the software easier to understand and learn. 

The user input management is the part that stores and displays information beside the 3d model and each of the data should link to specific part of the 3d model. Also, the display of such data should be made when rendering the 3d model and in a 3d like structure.
