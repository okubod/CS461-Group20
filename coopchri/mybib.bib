ABSTRACT = {There is a growing interest in 3D content following the recent developments in 3D movies, 3D TVs and 3D smartphones. However, 3D content creation is still dominated by professionals, due to the high cost of 3D motion capture instruments. The availability of a low-cost motion capture system will promote 3D content generation by general users and accelerate the growth of the 3D market. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a real-time motion capture system based on a portable low-cost wireless camera sensor network. The proposed system performs motion capture based on the data-driven 3D human pose reconstruction method to reduce the computation time and to improve the 3D reconstruction accuracy. The system can reconstruct accurate 3D full-body poses at 16 frames per second using only eight markers on the subjectâ€™s body. The performance of the motion capture system is evaluated extensively in experiments.},

abstract = {<p> This study was designed to examine how several methods for completing tasks (such as scrolling and zooming) differ when using touch screen devices. The goal of this research is to identify which methods produce the least amount of errors, and require the shortest amount of time when trying to accomplish a task. The study also aims to answer whether certain methods are better suited for different screen sizes (i.e., phone sized screen vs. a tablet sized screen). Results indicated that the phone sized device allowed users to complete all tasks more quickly but required greater effort to complete the task than the tablet sized device. Certain methods were identified to reduce the amount of time to accomplish a task, produce fewer errors, and reduce the effort required to accomplish a task. </p>},
